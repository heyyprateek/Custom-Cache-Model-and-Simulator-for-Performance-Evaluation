# ece_563_cache_simulation
Simulation of cache hierarchy with prefetch buffer
1. Type "make" to build.  (Type "make clean" first if you already compiled and want to recompile from scratch.)

2. Run trace reader:

   To run without throttling output:
   ./sim 32 8192 4 262144 8 3 10 ../example_trace.txt

   To run with throttling (via "less"):
   ./sim 32 8192 4 262144 8 3 10 ../example_trace.txt | less

   To run and confirm that all requests in the trace were read correctly:
   ./sim 32 8192 4 262144 8 3 10 ../example_trace.txt > echo_trace.txt
   diff ../example_trace.txt echo_trace.txt
	The result of "diff" should indicate that the only difference is that echo_trace.txt has the configuration information.
